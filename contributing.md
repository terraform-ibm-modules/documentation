# Welcome to IBM Cloud Terraform Modules contributing guide

:+1::tada: Thank you for taking the time to our project! :tada::+1:

This guide provides an overview of the ways that you can contribute, and provides links to the details.

## New contributor guide

For more information about the project, see the [documentation](https://terraform-ibm-modules.github.io/documentation/).

Read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

The following types of contributions might give you ideas about what you can contribute.

- Limitations in a current module
- Improvements and fixes to existing modules
- New solutions that address your use cases

Although code is a common contribution, you can also contribute in other ways to help the effort, such as by updating documentation, and submitting new ideas and bug reports. Post an issue in the [issue tracker repo](https://github.com/terraform-ibm-modules/terraform-ibm-issue-tracker/issues) if you want to chat about your ideas.

:information_source: *TODO*: Decide whether to set up the `Discussion` section in the issue tracker repos for discussing ideas, problems, etc.

This project is built on your contributions. Delivering a draft is better than not contributing anything. Don't wait until you craft the perfect solution, start by providing your unpolished masterpiece. The maintainers can support you and help deliver something that works for the widest audience.

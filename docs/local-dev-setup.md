# Local development setup

Follow these steps to set up your local development environment for working with the `terraform-ibm-modules` project. See [Contributing to the IBM Cloud Terraform modules project](contribute-module.md) for detailed steps about how to create or update a module.

?> **Tip**: For regular maintenance tasks, see [Regular developer tasks](dev-maintenance.md).

## Before you begin

[inc-prereqs-dev.md](inc-prereqs-dev.md ':include')

## Fork, clone, and initialize the repo

[inc-fork](inc-fork.md ':include')

## Add the dependencies

[inc-make](inc-make.md ':include')

## Next steps

That's it. Your development environment is set up the `terraform-ibm-modules` project. Now [contribute to a module](contribute-module.md).

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for IBM Cloud Terraform Modules. Following these guidelines helps maintainers to understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

* Before creating bug reports, please check [this repo](https://github.com/terraform-ibm-modules/terraform-ibm-issue-tracker/issues) as you might find out that you don't need to create one.

* When you are creating a bug report, please use the [ISSUE-TEMPLATE](https://github.com/terraform-ibm-modules/terraform-ibm-issue-tracker/issues/new/choose).

* Fill out [the required template](https://github.com/terraform-ibm-modules/terraform-ibm-issue-tracker/issues/new/choose), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

?> **Tip** If you find a closed issue that seems to what you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

## How do i submit a (good) bug report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/terraform-ibm-modules/terraform-ibm-issue-tracker/issues).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, which template have you used, what are the input values you passed and what version of module you are using etc, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead.**
* **Include screenshots** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.

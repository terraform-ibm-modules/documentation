# Report an issue or request a feature

Issues and feature requests are tracked as GitHub issues in the [terraform-ibm-issue-tracker](https://github.com/terraform-ibm-modules/terraform-ibm-issue-tracker/issues) repo.

Follow these guidelines to help the project maintainers to understand your issue, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

- Before you create an issue, check the [terraform-ibm-issue-tracker](https://github.com/terraform-ibm-modules/terraform-ibm-issue-tracker/issues) repo for similar issues.

    :information_source: **Tip**: If you find a closed issue that seems to what you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

- When you create an issue, feature request, or other idea, use an [issue template](https://github.com/terraform-ibm-modules/terraform-ibm-issue-tracker/issues/new/choose). The information that's requested in the template helps us resolve issues faster.

For more information, see the [readme file](https://github.com/terraform-ibm-modules/terraform-ibm-issue-tracker/blob/main/README.md) in the `terraform-ibm-issue-tracker` repo.

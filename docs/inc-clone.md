        ```bash
        git clone git@github.com:terraform-ibm-modules/<REPO_NAME>.git
        ```

    - To clone by using HTTPS, run the following command.

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.ibm.com/terraform-ibm-modules/<REPO_NAME>.git
        ```

    Where `<REPO_NAME>` is an existing `terraform-ibm-modules` repo.

1.  Initialize the Git submodule.

    git submodule update --init
    ```
